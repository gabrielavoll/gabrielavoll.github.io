This blog itself is my first utilization of a javascript module, Harp and Jade. Which from its github describes itself as:</p><p>"Static Site Server/Generator with built-in preprocessing"</p><p>This pretty aptly sums it up. I utilized it becasue I wanted to make a mostly Javascript static site on Github pages,, so I looked for something that would make my life more easy.</p><p>Setup for harp was incredible easy</p><div class="terminal-text">sudo npm install harp -g</div><p>and then just</p><div class="terminal-text">harp init myFirstHarpApp</div><p>to generate the directory for your new harp app, with the following inside:</p><ul class="terminal-text"><li>/myFirstHarpApp</li><li>|-- 404.jade</li><li>|-- _layout.jade</li><li>|-- index.jade</li><li>|-- main.less</li></ul><p>At this point you can run,</p><div class="terminal-text">harp server</div><p>and you will harp web server running at localhost:9000, with the inital Welcome text. Now at this point I moved all of the intial pages into a folder called /_harp inside the root directory, so when I put it on github.io my harp files would not get rendered.</p><p>To compile our app into its final static form, all you run is:</p><div class="terminal-text">harp compile _harp ./</div><p>this will compile all our files in _harp/ into flattened html and css into the root directory of the project. So at this point the myFirstHarpApp is ready to be visible on Github.io</p><p>As a note now that all server files are inside of the /_harp, to run the server you should cd into the /_harp folder and run the server from there, opposed to in the root directory</p><p>At the moment before writing this little article, I had just made a splash page, with my name, title and an image that I am using as my impromptu logo. After this article is complete, I will be on my way to having a blog.</p><p>Making the article itself was very simple, I chose to go the route of utilzing a jade file for my first one, maybe I will switch it up to Markdown or EJS next time. To make an article, first I made an articles directory</p><div class="terminal-text">mkdir articles <br>
cd articles</div><p>then i create my jade file for the new article, this article is called Intial Post, and its url is /articles/inital-post, which is directly derived from the jade file name, intial-post.jade. And i created a basic metadata file _data.json, inside the articles/ folder</p><div class="terminal-text">touch intial-post.jade <br>
touch _data.json</div><p>My metadata is very bare right now, with just the title and date. But it is obvious there is alot more you can do with the _data.json file, since the documentation says you can specify the specific articles layout from there, and more I reckon.</p><p>And thats it after that I had my first article live on my site, albeit it is not super accessible right now, since I have put off making a navigation bar. To update what is up on my github.io all I do is.</p><div class="terminal-text">harp compile _harp ./</div></div></div><div class="intro-container dark footer"><div class="intro-inner"><div class="center"><div class="social-icons"><a href="https://www.github.com/gato333"><div class="social-icon github"></div></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielavoll/"><div class="social-icon linkedin"></div></a></div></div><p class="center">Gabriela Voll Full-stack Web Developer<br/><a href="mailto:gvoll333@gmail.com">gvoll333@gmail.com</a></p></div></div></body></html>
