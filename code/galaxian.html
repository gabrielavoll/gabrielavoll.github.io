I never had a huge love of the game but i thought such a famous game would be fun to recreate. I made this game entirely in Processing (a kind of java/javascript-like language). More on it available <a href="https://processing.org/overview/">here.</a> I first learned how to program in this language in a Game Programming class I took in college in 2014, and have since grown a kind of fondness for it.</p><p>First I wrote it in Processing's Java mode and then translated into Javascript mode, so that i could put it online. There are very few differences between the modes, but it was a real pain in the ass transitioning since the debugger in Processing2 is not the best. But I found this <a href="http://processingjs.org/articles/p5QuickStart.html">article</a> that discusses the transition helpful, and I wish I had found it earlier on in the processs.</p><p>More on the game, is that to be 100% honest, I have never played Galaxian all that much and the last time I have played it was probably 12 years ago, so my memory of the game itself is a bit hazy and I definetly had to do some research to make it more accurate.</p><p>The game has 3 levels,</p><p>difficulty comes exclusively from the increased speed of the enemies.</p><p>There are no power ups, or 1ups like in the original. So 3 lives is all you get.</p><p>And the game is a bit slow until you have made 9 kills and at that time enemies will start to move out of their normal back and forth loop, and shoot thier own lasers.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="intro-inner"><div class="center"><div class="social-icons"><a href="https://www.github.com/gato333"><div class="social-icon github"></div></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielavoll/"><div class="social-icon linkedin"></div></a></div></div><p class="center">Gabriela Voll Full-stack Web Developer<br/><a href="mailto:gvoll333@gmail.com">gvoll333@gmail.com</a></p></div></div></body></html>
