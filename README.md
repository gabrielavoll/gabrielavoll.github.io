This is my Github.io static blog. Decided to do it in javascript and since github.io only allows static pages, I decided to go the route of utilizing Harp.


## Setup
```
	git clone git@github.com:gato333/Blog.io.git
	cd Blog.io
	( have harp module installed on your local computer, then )
	harp server
```
