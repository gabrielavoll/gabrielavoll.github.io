				p "Art and its creation can be framed as kind of mediation and ritualistic process.
				p The process of making art, allows the artist to hold space for themselves, as well as work through their thoughts and ideologies.
				p The objects themselves that are created through the process, give life to the afore mentioned beliefs and ideologies, and act as a kind of evidence and justification for them.
				p The positive energy generated by art and art-making is much like a blessing or a prayer.
				p Before we can bless anyone else, first we must bless ourselves."
