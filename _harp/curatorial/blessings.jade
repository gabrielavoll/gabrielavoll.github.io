				p The Living Gallery is pleased to present Blessings: Art Show, and exhibition of all New York City based artist.

				p Participants of the show are as follows:
				p Gabriela Voll, Annette Voll, Mona Zeitoun, Mercy Weiss, Rita Perez, Shanika Powell, Rachel Luz, and Shaquila Rivers
				br

				p "Art and its creation can be framed as kind of mediation and ritualistic process.
				p The process of making art, allows the artist to hold space for themselves, as well as work through their thoughts and ideologies.
				p The objects themselves that are created through the process, give life to the aforementioned beliefs and ideologies, and act as a kind of evidence and justification for them.
				p The positive energy generated by art and art-making is much like a blessing or a prayer.
				p Before we can bless anyone else, first we must bless ourselves."
