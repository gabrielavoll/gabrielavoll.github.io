		p I started on this little game as a kind of visual programming exercise, based on the classic game Galaxian. I never had a huge love of the game but i thought such a famous game would be fun to recreate. I made this game entirely in Processing (a kind of java/javascript-like language). More on it available 
			a(href="https://processing.org/overview/") here.
			|  I first learned how to program in this language in a Game Programming class I took in college in 2014, and have since grown a kind of fondness for it.
		p First I wrote it in Processing's Java mode and then translated into Javascript mode, so that i could put it online. There are very few differences between the modes, but it was a real pain in the ass transitioning since the debugger in Processing2 is not the best. But I found this 
			a(href="http://processingjs.org/articles/p5QuickStart.html") article
			|  that discusses the transition helpful, and I wish I had found it earlier on in the processs.
		p More on the game, is that to be 100% honest, I have never played Galaxian all that much and the last time I have played it was probably 12 years ago, so my memory of the game itself is a bit hazy and I definetly had to do some research to make it more accurate.
		p The game has 3 levels,
		p difficulty comes exclusively from the increased speed of the enemies.
		p There are no power ups, or 1ups like in the original. So 3 lives is all you get.
		p And the game is a bit slow until you have made 9 kills and at that time enemies will start to move out of their normal back and forth loop, and shoot thier own lasers.
